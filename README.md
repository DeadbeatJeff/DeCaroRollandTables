# RollandTables

This repo has my MATLAB code for 1) de Caro-Rolland tables, which are an extension of Denavit-Hartenberg tables, which allow the automation of the contstruction of the Lagragian for a robot arm, 2) the Lagrangian of the robot arm, 3) the equation of motion (EoM) of the robot arm, 4) the Riemannian metric (r-metric) of the configuration space (c-space) of the robot arm, 5) the Christoffel symbols of the c-space, and 4) the sectional curvature of the c-space.
