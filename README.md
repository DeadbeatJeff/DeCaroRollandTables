# RollandTables

This repo has my MATLAB code for 1) Rolland tables, which are an extension of Denavit-Hartenberg tables, which allow the automation of the contstruction of the Labragian for a robot arm, 2) the Lagrangain of the robot arm, 3) the equationof motion (EoM) of the robot arm, 4) th Riemannian metric (r-metric) of the configuration space (c-space) of the robot arm, 5) the Christoffel symbols of the c-space, and 4) the sectional curvature of the c-space.
